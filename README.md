# Network-Lab
Networking Labs for Routing and Switching

I created this lab while I was learning MPLS-VPN technology. I have included the screenshot of the topology as well.

Requirements:
1. GNS3  --> https://gns3.com/software/download
2. Cisco Router - C7200 (used in the lab)
3. IOS Image --> Cisco IOS Software, 7200 Software (C7200-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 12.4(24)T, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Note: When you download GNS3, you do not get the IOS images for the routers. Either, you can pay for it or find it online (Just Google it)

Prerequisite:
Following is a very good Cisco documentation, which get me started. Please read the following
http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/mp_l3_vpns/configuration/15-mt/mp-l3-vpns-15-mt-book/mp-bgp-mpls-vpn.html

After, you have read the documentation, then proceed to lab and start by unzipping the file i have uploaded
